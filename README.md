# Blockchain Smart Contract Analysis & Auditing

## Overview
This repository contains my research, analysis, and audits of various blockchain smart contracts and protocols. The primary focus is on identifying vulnerabilities, optimizing security, and ensuring the robustness of decentralized applications (dApps).

## Skills & Expertise
- **Smart Contract Auditing**: Analysis of Ethereum-based smart contracts for security vulnerabilities.
- **Solidity Development**: Writing and optimizing secure smart contracts.
- **DeFi Protocol Analysis**: Understanding and auditing DeFi smart contracts like Uniswap, Aave, and Compound.
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Identifying issues such as reentrancy, integer overflow/underflow, front-running, and logic flaws.
- **Gas Optimization**: Improving smart contract efficiency to minimize transaction costs.
- **NFT & Token Standards**: Analysis and development of ERC-20, ERC-721, and ERC-1155 tokens.
- **Blockchain & Web3 Integration**: Implementing secure interactions between smart contracts and frontend applications using Web3.js and Ethers.js.

## Research Areas
- **Smart Contract Exploits & Defenses**
- **Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) Bytecode Analysis**
- **Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Security**
