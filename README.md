# Blockchain Smart Contract Analysis & Auditing

## msg.sender=Uday kiran Pedda

## Introduction
This Repo  is dedicated to smart contract analysis, security auditing, and blockchain development. I explore vulnerabilities, security best practices, and decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols.

## My Skills & Expertise
- **Smart Contract Auditing**: Reviewing Ethereum smart contracts for security flaws.
- **Solidity Development**: Writing and optimizing secure smart contracts.
- **DeFi Security**: Analyzing protocols like Uniswap, Aave, and Compound.

- **Gas Optimization**: Reducing transaction costs by improving contract efficiency.
- **Token Standards**: Developing and analyzing ERC-20, ERC-721  tokens.
- **Blockchain & Web3**: Secure integration with frontend apps using Web3.js .

## Research Topics
- **Smart Contract Audits & Fixes**
- **Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)  Analysis**
- **DeFi & NFT Security**

## Audited Contracts
I have analyzed and audited several blockchain projects, including:
1. **Uniswap V2 Contracts** – Liquidity pool security analysis.
2. **ERC-20 Token Contracts** – Identifying common vulnerabilities.
3. **NFT Marketplaces** – Preventing fraud like wash trading and rug pulls.
4. **DeFi Lending Platforms** – Assessing flash loan risks.
5. **Custom Solidity Contracts** – Personal audits on smart contract security.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Solidity**
- **Foundry**
- **OpenZeppelin Security Libraries**
- **Foundry & Slither**
- ** Web3.js**
- **Remix IDE & VS Code**
- **IPFS storage **

## Collaboration & Contact
