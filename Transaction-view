****Current Ethereum Block Gas Limit***
.The Ethereum mainnet has a block gas limit of around 30 million gas (as of recent updates), but it changes dynamically based on network conditions and miner voting.

=> Example Calculation
.Suppose the block gas limit = 30,000,000 gas

.A simple ETH transfer costs ~ 21,000 gas

.The number of transactions in the block:

.30,000,000÷21,000≈1,428 transactions

##  If transaction exceeds  Block gas limit then Rejected!
